VoteSocial
==========

Election data + social networking

What's on your upcoming ballot? Have you done your research? 
Share your thoughts and conclusions with your friends.
Who are your friends voting for? Why? Discuss!

Implementation 
--------------

Vote Social aims to be agnostic about data sources and social 
networks. Our high-level Models are generic, not bound to any specific
data source. We hope to remain a relevant technology platform
as election systems evolve, and as social networks wax and wane 
in popularity.
